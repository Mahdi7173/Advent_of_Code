# [Advent of Code]

"Your tenacity for making things that make other things so that people can make things is alarming." -a beta tester

Hi! I'm [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). I made Advent of Code. I hope you like it! I also made [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/), [PHP Sadness](http://phpsadness.com/), and [lots of other things](http://was.tl/projects/). You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) and [GitHub](https://github.com/topaz).

_Advent of Code_ is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

## --- General Tips ---

If you get stuck, try your solution against the _examples_ given in the puzzle; you should get the same answers. If not, re-read the description. Did you misunderstand something? Is your program doing something you don't expect? After the examples work, if your answer still isn't correct, _build some test cases_ for which you can verify the answer by hand and see if those work with your program. If you're still stuck, maybe _ask a friend_ for help, or come back to the puzzle later. You can also ask for hints in the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/).

If you really think your solution is correct but your answer isn't accepted, and you think there might be a mistake in the puzzle itself because nobody else is solving it either (check the [stats](/stats) page), let me know via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). My beta testers and I have checked the challenges pretty thoroughly, but it's still possible that there's an error somewhere.
